This file contains ideas for examples and theorems which can be added.

**Theorems**
- relate monomorphism and injective?
- target finite-dimensional + morphism (?) => source finite-dimensional
- is there a relation between finite-dimensionality and Noetherianness?
- projective from locally projective + conditions on the base? (and how to generalize the other projective adjectives?)

**Adjectives**
- (universally) submersive
- epimorphism

**Examples**
