This file contains ideas for examples and theorems which can be added.

**Theorems**
- is there a relation between finite-dimensionality and Noetherianness?
- projective from locally projective + conditions on the base? (and how to generalize the other projective adjectives?)
- universally injective + (universally) surjective => universally bijective => universally open & closed

**Adjectives**
- (universally) submersive
- epimorphism
- (locally) quasi-(H)-projective https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01VV
- radical morphism https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01S3

**Examples**
- Hironaka's example [Hartshorne, Example B.3.4.1] (proper but not projective)
- p.71 of Fulton's toric varieties: proper but not projective
- Universal homeomorphism that is not of finite type & universal homeomorphism of finite type but not of finite presentation: Remark 10 of https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kelly/pdfs/uh%20non-fp.pdf, also see Exercise 6.8.3b of Eléments de mathématique. Fasc. XXX. Algèbre commutative
- locally projective but not projective: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/47208/is-projectivity-local-on-the-base
- for finite locally free not systemic, maybe look at https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~lenstrahw/PUBLICATIONS/1997c/art.pdf for inspiration.
