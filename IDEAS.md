This file contains ideas for examples and theorems which can be added.

**Theorems**
- relate monomorphism and injective?
- target finite-dimensional + morphism (?) => source finite-dimensional
- is there a relation between finite-dimensionality and Noetherianness?
- projective from locally projective + conditions on the base? (and how to generalize the other projective adjectives?)

**Adjectives**
- (universally) submersive
- epimorphism
- (locally) quasi-(H)-projective https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01VV
