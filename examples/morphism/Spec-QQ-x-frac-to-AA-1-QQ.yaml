type: morphism
name: $\Spec \QQ(x) \to \AA^1_\QQ$
description: The inclusion of the generic point $\Spec \QQ(x)$ into the affine line $\AA^1_\QQ$.
with:
  source: Spec-QQ-x-frac
  target: AA-1-QQ
adjectives:
  locally-of-finite-type: [false, "The ring $\\QQ(x)$ is not finitely generated as $\\QQ[x]$-algebra."]
  monomorphism: [true, "$\\Hom(\\QQ(x), R) \\to \\Hom(\\QQ[x], R)$ is clearly injective for all commutative rings $R$."]
  surjective: [false, The image contains none of the closed points.]
  open: [false, The generic point in $\AA^1_\QQ$ is not open.]
  closed: [false, The generic point in $\AA^1_\QQ$ is not closed.]
  flat: [true, The field of fractions is flat over any domain.]
  formally-smooth: [true, "Let $A$ be a $\\QQ$-algebra and $I \\subset A$ an ideal with $I^2 = 0$. It suffices to show that if $f(a)$ is invertible in $A/I$ for all $f \\in \\QQ[x]$ and $a \\in A$, then $f(a)$ is invertible in $A$. Indeed, there exists an element $b \\in A$ such that $f(a) b = 1 + i$ for some $i \\in I$, and hence $f(a) (b - bi) = 1$ in $A$."]
