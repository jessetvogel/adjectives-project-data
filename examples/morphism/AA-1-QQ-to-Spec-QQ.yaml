type: morphism
name: $\AA^1_\QQ \to \Spec \QQ$
description: The natural morphism from the affine line to the point, over the rational numbers.
with:
  source: AA-1-QQ
  target: Spec-QQ
adjectives:
  closed: [true, Any subset of $\Spec(\QQ)$ is closed.]
  immersion: [false, Not injective.]
  universally-closed: [false, "The base change $\\AA^2_\\QQ \\to \\AA^1_\\QQ$ of this morphism is not closed, as the image of $\\{ xy - 1 = 0 \\}$ is $\\{ x \\ne 0 \\}$ which is not closed."]
  locally-of-finite-presentation: [true, "$\\QQ[x]$ is a finite presentation over $\\QQ$."]
  smooth: [true, "$\\QQ[x]$ is standard smooth over $\\QQ$."]
  surjective: [true, The target consists of a single point and the source is non-empty.]
  formally-unramified: [false, "Let $A = \\QQ[t]/(t^2)$ with ideal $I = (t)$, and consider a map $\\QQ[x] \\to A/I = \\QQ$ given by $x \\mapsto q$. Then there are infinitely many lifts $\\QQ[x] \\to A$ given by $x \\mapsto q + rt$ for $r \\in \\QQ$."]
