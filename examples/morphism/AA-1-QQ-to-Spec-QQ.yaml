type: morphism
name: $\AA^1_\QQ \to \Spec \QQ$
description: The natural morphism from the affine line to the point, over the rational numbers.
with:
  source: AA-1-QQ
  target: Spec-QQ
adjectives:
  flat: [true, Everything is flat over a field.]
  closed: [true, Any subset of $\Spec(\QQ)$ is closed.]
  unramified: false
  immersion: [false, Not injective.]
  universally-closed: [false, "The base change $\\AA^2_\\QQ \\to \\AA^1_\\QQ$ of this morphism is not closed, as the image of $\\{ xy - 1 = 0 \\}$ is $\\{ x \\ne 0 \\}$ which is not closed."]
