type: morphism
name: $\AA^2_\QQ$ with double origin to $\Spec \QQ$
description: The natural morphism from $\AA^2_\QQ$ with double origin to $\Spec \QQ$.
with:
  source: AA-2-QQ-double-origin
  target: Spec-QQ
adjectives:
  semi-separated: [false, "The intersection of the two copies of $\\AA^2_\\QQ$ (which are both affine) is $\\AA^2_\\QQ \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$, which is not affine."]
  etale: [true, "Locally on the source, this morphism is the identity on $\\AA^2_\\QQ$, which is Ã©tale."]
  surjective: [true, The target consists of a single point and the source is non-empty.]
  finite-fibers: [false, "There is only one fiber, which is infinite."]
  closed: [true, The target is topologically discrete.]
