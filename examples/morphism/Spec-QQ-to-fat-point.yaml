type: morphism
name: $\Spec \QQ \to \Spec \QQ[x]/(x^2)$
description: The morphism defined by the quotient $\QQ[x]/(x^2) \to \QQ$.
with:
  source: Spec-QQ
  target: fat-point
adjectives:
  closed-immersion: [true, "The map on rings $\\QQ[x]/(x^2) \\to \\QQ$ is surjective."]
  flat: [false, "The inclusion $x \\QQ[x]/(x^2) \\hookrightarrow \\QQ[x]/(x^2)$ does not remain injective after tensoring with $\\QQ$ over $\\QQ[x]/(x^2)$."]
  homeomorphism: [true, Both spaces consist of a single point.]
  open-immersion: [false, It is surjective but not an isomorphism on global sections.]
