type: morphism
name: blowup morphism affine plane in origin
description: The blowup morphism from the blowup of the affine plane in the origin to the affine plane, over the rational numbers.
with:
  source: blowup-AA-2-QQ
  target: AA-2-QQ
adjectives:
  flat: [false, "The dimension of the fibre over the origin is 1, which is not the difference between the dimension of the domain and the dimension of the target."]
  surjective: true
  locally-of-finite-type: [true, "Outside of the exceptional divisor it is an isomorphism. Inside the exceptional divisor, it looks like $\\PP^1_\\QQ \\to \\AA^2_\\QQ$ mapping to the origin, which is also locally of finite type."]
  H-projective: [true, "It embeds in $\mathbb P^1_{\mathbb A^2}$."]
  finite-fibers: [false]
  open: [false]
  formally-unramified: [false]
