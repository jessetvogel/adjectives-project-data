type: morphism
name: affine line with double origin to affine line
description: The projection of the affine line with double origin over the rational numbers to the affine line.
with:
  source: AA-1-QQ-double-origin
  target: AA-1-QQ
adjectives:
  separated: [false, "Write $X$ for the affine line with double origin. Let $f : \\AA^1_\\QQ \\to X \\times_{\\AA^1_\\QQ} X$ be the morphism induced from the two different inclusions $\\AA^1_\\QQ \\to X$. Then $f^{-1}(\\Delta_{X/\\AA^1_\\QQ}(X)) = \\AA^1_\\QQ \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$ is not closed, so the diagonal is not closed."]
  semi-separated: [true, "Write $X$ for the affine line with double origin. Then $\\Delta_{X/\\AA^1_\\QQ}$ is affine as $X \\times_{\\AA^1_\\QQ} X$ can be covered by affines (four affine lines) whose pre-images are all affine."]
