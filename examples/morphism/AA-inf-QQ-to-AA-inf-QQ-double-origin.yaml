type: morphism
name: $\AA^\infty_\QQ$ to $\AA^\infty_\QQ$ with double origin
description: The natural morphism from $\AA^\infty_\QQ$ to $\AA^\infty_\QQ$ with double origin (mapping to the first copy of $\AA^\infty_\QQ$).
with:
  source: AA-inf-QQ
  target: AA-inf-QQ-double-origin
adjectives:
  open-immersion: [true, "By construction."]
  quasi-compact: [false, "The pre-image of the second copy of $\\AA^\\infty_\\QQ$ is $\\AA^\\infty_\\QQ \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$, which is not quasi-compact."]
  closed: [false, "The image of $\\AA^\\infty_\\QQ$ is not closed as it does not contain the second origin."]
