type: morphism
name: $\AA^\infty_\QQ$ with double origin to $\AA^\infty_\QQ$
description: The natural morphism from $\AA^\infty_\QQ$ with double origin to $\AA^\infty_\QQ$.
with:
  source: AA-inf-QQ-double-origin
  target: AA-inf-QQ
adjectives:
  etale: [true, "Locally, it is the identity morphism, which is Ã©tale."]
  universally-closed: [true, "The source can be covered by finitely many opens $U_i$ ($U_1 = U_2 = \\AA^\\infty_\\QQ$) such that the restrictions $U_i \\to \\AA^\\infty_\\QQ$ are universally closed (in fact, they are the identity)."]
