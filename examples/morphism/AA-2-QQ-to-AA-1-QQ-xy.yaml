type: morphism
name: degenerating family of conics
description: The morphism induced by the ring morphism $\QQ[x, y] \to \QQ[t]$ given by $t \mapsto xy$.
with:
  source: AA-2-QQ
  target: AA-1-QQ
adjectives:
  smooth: [false, Since $\partial (xy - t)/\partial x = y$ and $\partial (xy - t)/\partial y = x$ both vanish at the point $x = y = 0$.]
  closed: [false, "The image of the closed set $\\{ xy^2 = 1 \\}$ is the open set $\\{ x \\ne 0 \\}$, which is not closed."]
  locally-of-finite-presentation: [true, "Using the presentation $\\QQ[x, y] \\cong \\QQ[x, y, t] / (xy - t)$."]
