type: morphism
name: squaring map on affine line
with:
  source: AA-1-QQ
  target: AA-1-QQ
description: The morphism $\AA^1_\QQ \to \AA^1_\QQ$ given by $x \mapsto x^2$.
adjectives:
  flat: [true, "$\\QQ[x] \\cong \\QQ[x^2] \\oplus x \\cdot \\QQ [x^2]$ as $\\QQ[x^2]$-module, and free modules are flat."]
  smooth: [false, "It is not smooth at the origin, since $\\partial x^2 / \\partial x = 2x$ evaluates to $0$ at $x = 0$."]
  locally-of-finite-presentation: [true, "$\\QQ[x, y] / (y^2 - x)$ is of finite presentation over $\\QQ[x]$."]
  homeomorphism: [false, Injectivity fails.]
  surjective: [true, "The generic point maps to the generic point, and every point has a 'square root'."]
  finite: [true, "$\\QQ[x]$ is a finitely generated $\\QQ[x^2]$-module, since $\\QQ[x] \\cong \\QQ[x^2] \\oplus x \\cdot \\QQ [x^2]$."]
  regular: [true, "It is flat and all fibers are geometrically regular."]
