type: morphism
name: affine line with infinitely many origins to affine line
description: The projection of the affine line with infinitely many origins over the rational numbers to the affine line.
with:
  source: AA-1-QQ-inf-origins
  target: AA-1-QQ
adjectives:
  closed: [true, "The closed subsets of the source are either $\\varnothing$, the whole space, or a finite set of closed points, all of whose images are indeed closed in $\\AA^1_\\QQ$."]
  etale: [true, Being Ã©tale is local on the source.]
  injective: [false, All origins map to the same point.]
  surjective: true
  separated: false
  finite-fibers: false
  semi-separated: [true, "The target can be covered by infinitely many affine lines, each of whose pullback is either a copy of the affine line, or a copy of (the affine line minus the origin); both of these are themselves affine."]
