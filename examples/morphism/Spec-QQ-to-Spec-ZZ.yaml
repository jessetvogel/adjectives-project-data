type: morphism
name: $\Spec \QQ \to \Spec \ZZ$
description: The unique morphism from $\Spec \QQ$ to $\Spec \ZZ$, which is also the generic point of $\Spec \ZZ$.
with:
  source: Spec-QQ
  target: Spec-ZZ
adjectives:
  closed: [false, The generic point is not closed.]
  immersion: [false, "Every open of $\\Spec \\ZZ$ is of the form $\\Spec \\ZZ_n$ for some integer $n \\in \\ZZ$. If this map would be an immersion, then for some $n \\in \\ZZ$ the induced map $\\ZZ_n \\to \\QQ$ would be surjective, which cannot be the case."]
  surjective: [false, The prime ideals $(p)$ for $p$ prime do not lie in the image.]
  locally-of-finite-type: false
  open: false
  flat: [true, Localizations are flat.]
