type: morphism
name: $\sqcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} \PP^n_\QQ$ to affine line with infinitely many origins
description: The morphism which sends the $\PP^n_\QQ$ to the $n$-th copy of the origin.
with:
  source: inf-sqcup-PP-n-QQ
  target: AA-1-QQ-inf-origins
adjectives:
  projective: [true]
  bundle-projective: [false]
  injective: [false, All points of $\PP^n_\QQ$ map to the same point.]
  flat: [false]
  quasi-affine: [false, "The inverse image of any affine line is some copy of $\\PP^n_\\QQ$, none of which are quasi-affine."]
  surjective: [false, "The points away from the origins do not lie in the image."]
