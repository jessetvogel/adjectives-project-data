type: morphism
name: $\Spec \QQ[x, y]/(xy) \to \AA^1_\QQ$
description: The morphism from $\Spec \QQ[x, y]/(xy)$ to $\AA^1_\QQ$ given by projection to the $x$-axis, that is, the morphism corresponding to the natural ring morphism $\QQ[x] \to \QQ[x, y]/(x, y)$.

  source: plane-axes
  target: AA-1-QQ
adjectives:
  flat: [false]
  immersion: [false]
  locally-of-finite-presentation: [true, "Clear from the expression $\\QQ[x] \\to \\QQ[x, y]/(xy)$."]
  surjective: true
  universally-closed: [false, "Base change to the map $\\QQ[x, z] \\to \\QQ[x, y, z] / (xy)$. Then the closed subset $\\{ yz - 1 = 0 \\}$ maps to $\\{ x = 0, z \\ne 0 \\}$, which is not closed."]
