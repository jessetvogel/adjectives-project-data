type: scheme
name: $\AA^2_\QQ$ with double origin
description: Let $X_1 = X_2 = \AA^2_\QQ = \Spec \QQ[x, y]$. The scheme $X$ is obtained by gluing $X_1$ and $X_2$ along the complement of the origin $0 = (x, y)$.
adjectives:
  quasi-compact: [true, Both copies of $\AA^2_\QQ$ are quasi-compact (as they are affine).]
  integral: [true]
