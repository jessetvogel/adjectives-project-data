type: scheme
name: cusp
description: The scheme $\Spec \QQ[x, y]/(y^2 - x^3)$.
adjectives:
  affine: [true, By definition.]
  integral: [true, "The ring $\\QQ[x, y]/(y^2 - x^3)$ is a domain as $y^2 - x^3$ is irreducible."]
  normal: [false, "The ring $R = \\QQ[x, y]/(y^2 - x^3)$ is not integrally closed: the element $t = y/x$ is integral (as $t^2 = x$) but does not lie in $R$."]
  locally-noetherian: [true, "The ring $\\QQ[x, y]/(y^2 - x^3)$ is Noetherian."]
