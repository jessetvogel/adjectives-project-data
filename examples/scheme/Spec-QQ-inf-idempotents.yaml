name: "$\\Spec \\QQ[x_1, x_2, \\ldots] / (x_i^2 - x_i, x_i x_j : i \\ne j)$"
description: The spectrum of the quotient of $\QQ[x_1, x_2, \ldots]$ by the ideal generated by all elements of the form $x_i^2 - x_i$ and $x_i x_j$ for $i \ne j$.
adjectives:
  affine: [true, By definition.]
  integral: [false, There are zero-divisors as $x_i x_j = 0$ for all $i \ne j$.]
