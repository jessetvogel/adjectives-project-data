type: scheme
name: nodal cubic
description: The scheme $\Spec \QQ[x, y] / (y^2 - x^3 - x^2)$.
adjectives:
  affine: [true, By definition.]
  integral: [ true, "The polynomial $f = y^2 - x^3 - x^2$ is irreducible, so $\\QQ[x, y] / (f)$ is a domain."]
  locally-noetherian: [true, "The ring $\\QQ[x, y] / (y^2 - x^3 - x^2)$ is Noetherian."]
