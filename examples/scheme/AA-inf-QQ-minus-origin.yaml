type: scheme
name: $\AA^\infty_\QQ \setminus \{ 0 \}$
description: The open complement of the origin inside $\AA^\infty_\QQ = \Spec \QQ[x_1, x_2, \ldots]$.
adjectives:
  integral: [true, "It is an open subset of $\\AA^\\infty_\\QQ$, which is integral since $\\QQ[x_1, x_2, \\ldots]$ is a domain."]
  quasi-compact: [false, "The open cover $U_i = \\{ x_i \\ne 0 \\}$, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots$, does not have a finite subcover."]
  locally-noetherian: [false]
  finite-dimensional: [false]
