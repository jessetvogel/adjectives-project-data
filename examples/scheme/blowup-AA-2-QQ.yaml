type: scheme
name: blowup $\AA^2_\QQ$ in origin
description: The blowup of the affine plane in the origin, over the rational numbers.
adjectives:
  affine: false
  integral: [true, "The blowup can be covered by affine patches $\\Spec \\QQ[x, y, u] / (uy - x) \\cong \\Spec \\QQ[y, u]$ and $\\Spec \\QQ[x, y, v] / (vx - y) \\cong \\Spec \\QQ[x, v]$, both of which are integral."]
  regular: true
  quasi-compact: [true, "As it can be covered by two affine patches."]
