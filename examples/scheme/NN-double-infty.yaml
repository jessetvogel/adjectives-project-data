type: scheme
name: $\NN$ with two points at infinity
description: Let $X = \Spec R$, where $R$ is the ring of continuous maps from the one-point compactification of $\NN$ to $\FF_2$, and let $x \in X$ be the point at infinity. Then glue two copies of $X$ along $X \setminus \{ x \}$.
adjectives:
  affine: [false, "The ring of global functions is again $R$, but the scheme is not isomorphic to $\\Spec R$."]
  integral: [false, "The ring $R$ is not a domain: if $f = (1, 0, 0, \\ldots)$ and $g = (0, 1, 0, 0, \\ldots)$ in $R$, then $f g = 0$."]
  locally-noetherian: [false, "The ring $R$ is not Noetherian: the chain of ideals $I_n = \\{ f \\in R \\mid f(m) = 0 \\textup{ for } m \\ge n \\}$ does not stabilize."]
  quasi-compact: [true, "As $X$ is affine, it is quasi-compact, so the gluing of two such copies is also quasi-compact."]
  reduced: [true, "Clearly $R$ is reduced, so both copies of $X$ are reduced."]
